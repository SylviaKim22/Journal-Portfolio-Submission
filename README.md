# Journal-Portfolio-Submission
I was to develop an object-oriented programming application to create two clocks that displayed simultaneously and allowed user input using secure and efficient C++ coding.
I particularly did well in properly modularizing and writing the functions so that my main() had the least amount of coding.
I would not enhance the code and leave it as it is.
The hardest pieces of the code I found the most challenging to write was differentiating the 24 and 12 hour clocks. To overcome this, I decided to take it step by step and finish the 12hr coding first then the 24hr. I had also looked into SNHU resources for advice or tips on creating the code.
The skills from this project would be transferable to other projects if something needs to be done simultaneously. Using this code will aid in that, and it doesn't just have to be clocks or time.
I made this code maintainable, readable, and adaptable by keeping the coding properly modularized and the coding at a minimum. Having the core/main functions in the coding will keep it maintable and readable.
